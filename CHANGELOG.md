# Changelog

All notable changes to Axiomize are documented here. Axiomize follows semantic versioning; release claims are tied to exact-wheel CI/release evidence.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- the quantum-reasoning skill is now a self-contained skill folder, `skills/quantum-reasoning/`, holding `SKILL.md`, `VERSION`, `docs/` and `examples/` (moved from the flat `skills/quantum-reasoning-SKILL.md` file)
- `axiomize.reasoning.benchmark` is now an importable subpackage; the evaluator and submission validator still run standalone
- ported benchmark/submission contracts as `tests/test_reasoning_benchmark.py` (9 tests) and the reasoning + Model IR bridge tests in `tests/test_reasoning_quantum.py` (11 tests) — 20 new tests total
- `skills/quantum-reasoning/SKILL.md` frontmatter description now carries an explicit trigger phrase so skill loaders route it correctly
- `dist/` and `build/` are ignored; local wheel builds no longer show up as untracked files

### Changed

- `skills/axiomize/tools/check_skill.py` now validates every skill folder in the repo (frontmatter, folder/name match, trigger phrase and relative links) instead of only `skills/axiomize`
- both CI and the release workflow run the full quantum-reasoning contract (`tests/test_reasoning_quantum.py` + `tests/test_reasoning_benchmark.py`)
- the quantum-reasoning docs live only in `skills/quantum-reasoning/docs/`; the duplicated copies under `src/axiomize/reasoning/docs/` were removed
- relative links in the ported skill docs, examples and benchmark README now resolve inside the merged layout
- `pyproject.toml` ships the whole skill folder in the wheel as `axiomize/quantum-reasoning/`

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-16

### Merged

- merged standalone `quantum-reasoning-skill` v0.3.1 into `axiomize.reasoning` (same `axiomize` repo name, now version 2.0)
  - `src/axiomize/reasoning/branch_controller.py` — deterministic branch score/prune/revive/collapse logic, ported verbatim
  - `src/axiomize/reasoning/benchmark/` — evaluator, submission validator, seed cases + JSON schemas
  - `src/axiomize/reasoning/docs/` — MEASUREMENT + COMPATIBILITY contracts
  - `skills/quantum-reasoning/` — model-facing protocol, docs and examples (moved from the standalone repo layout)
  - `tests/test_reasoning_quantum.py` — 8 ported tests, all passing
- previous `quantum-reasoning-skill` repo is superseded; its README now points here and the repo will be archived

## [1.12.2] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed / hardened

- synchronized the public README package line with the actual release version and made release CI enforce README/CHANGELOG/package/trigger version lockstep
- blocked the Release workflow from publishing when manually dispatched against any ref other than `refs/heads/main`
- rejected boolean values at shared finite numeric boundaries instead of silently coercing `True`/`False` to `1.0`/`0.0`
- bounded textual integer parsing before conversion so oversized integer strings fail before interpreter-dependent parsing limits are reached
- made run-manifest format-version validation exact, rejecting booleans and fractional values that previously could be accepted through `int(...)` coercion
- closed the superseded unmerged 1.12.0 scientific-maturity draft PR after the shipped 1.12.0/1.12.1 line replaced it

### Release gates

- full Python 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.13 validation
- security contract and dependency audit
- source and installed import-graph contracts
- exact built-wheel CLI/Model IR/export/surrogate/LaTeX/scientific stress checks
- Ubuntu/Linux, Windows and macOS exact-wheel CLI smoke
- Trusted Publishing-first PyPI publication and verification

## [1.12.1] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- PDE automatic solver planning now uses the same real `FEniCSAdapter.availability()` probe as the executable FEM path.
- DOLFINx-only installations are correctly routed to the bounded FEM executor instead of being misclassified as SciPy/method-of-lines only.
- a merely importable but unrunnable legacy FEniCS installation no longer causes the planner to advertise FEM execution incorrectly.
- public `general_engine.select_solver()` and direct `general_engine_core.select_solver()` now share the same PDE backend decision contract while preserving explicit user solver configuration.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- all-family scientific benchmark/stress matrix with explicit per-case and total runtime budgets
- permanent exact-installed-wheel scientific stress gate in CI and release preflight
- Causal Engine 2.0:
  - DAG cycle validation
  - explicit/DAG-derived backdoor adjustment
  - post-treatment-adjustment rejection
  - AIPW doubly-robust, IPW and outcome-regression estimates for binary treatment
  - robust continuous-treatment backdoor regression
  - positivity/overlap, effective-sample-size and covariate-balance diagnostics
  - bounded intervention/counterfactual predictions
- package-native Bayesian Engine 2.0:
  - bounded multi-chain random-walk Metropolis
  - split R-hat, bulk ESS and MCSE
  - posterior interval summaries
  - posterior predictive RMSE, predictive coverage and Bayesian p-values
- real optional structured FEniCS/DOLFINx FEM executor for bounded scalar Poisson P1 problems on unit intervals/squares
- numerical-verification contracts for every Model IR family; stochastic between-seed variability remains explicitly separate from numerical error
- Modelica 3.6 textual export for supported ODE/DAE/algebraic models
- GraphML network export
- Graphviz DOT causal-DAG export
- `axiomize.portable-bundle.v1` export with canonical Model IR SHA-256 integrity metadata

### Changed

- runtime capability discovery now advertises Causal Engine 2.0, Bayesian diagnostics/PPC, all-family numerical verification and extended exports
- FEniCS availability is based on a real executable backend probe rather than module-name presence
- README, ROADMAP and CHANGELOG now describe the actual hardened scientific engine rather than the older prompt/skill-only architecture

### Release gates

- Python 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.13 validation
- security contract and dependency vulnerability audit
- source and installed import-graph contracts
- exact built wheel installation and full CLI/Model IR/export/surrogate/LaTeX checks
- all-family scientific stress matrix
- Ubuntu/Linux, Windows and macOS exact-wheel CLI smoke
- Trusted Publishing-first PyPI publication and verification

## [1.11.2] - 2026-09-05

### Security / correctness

- replaced permissive mathematical parsing paths with a bounded AST-whitelist boundary and explicit AST→SymPy construction
- removed arbitrary `eval()` use from Z3 constraint handling; added solver timeout and denominator-domain guards
- hardened Model IR namespaces, targets, bounds, finite values, solver settings and schema migrations
- prevented silent future-schema migration and schema-version relabeling
- made arbitrary Python and Lean execution explicit-trust operations with reduced environment inheritance and resource/time limits
- confined REST/MCP run-file access to configured run roots; added request/message/concurrency/read-time limits and safer errors
- added provider URL/redirect/request/response/timeout hardening
- added run-state content integrity verification and atomic persistence
- added hard non-bypassable limits for arrays, draws, networks, optimization, event queues, PDE work, causal matrices and other native executors
- hardened LaTeX conversion with a mathematical macro allow-list and `-no-shell-escape`
- corrected finite-horizon SIR validation versus asymptotic final-size theory
- hardened direct SciPy/CVXPy/CasADi/statsmodels/PyMC/benchmark/playground/CSV/parallel-sweep surfaces
- preserved first-occurrence order when duplicate data are merged with `sort_time=False`

### CI / supply chain

- immutable commit-SHA pinning for external GitHub Actions
- permanent security-contract scanner
- dependency vulnerability audit
- direct adversarial runtime regressions
- release verification hardened against PyPI propagation delay without weakening Trusted Publishing or exact-artifact gates
